/// Welcome to my Latest Project /// 

So in this project I tried to create a working portfolio website that I can use in the future and update as needed, below I will list the key features it contains. 

// Home Page
On the home page I had a few requirements, I wanted to implement bootstrap buttons and styling, as well as a card for any featured projects 
that I add later on down the line. If you notice, you'll see quick links underneath a hero section, as well as a bootstrap navbar that can take you 
to all of the portions of the site. I tried to keep all the styling matching on every single page, and the buttons have a readable fade that I feel 
is more pleasing to the eye than it highlighting them. 

// About Page 
on the about page I tried to feature another hero section, this time with a brief description about me. However, when you click the button on the 
hero section I also created a modular that pops up and gives you an interesting fact about my journey in this coding bootcamp here in Coding Temple. 
I don't feel this is the best use of this currently but it gives me a feature that I can change and structure later once I figure out a better way to use it. 
There is also a table located below my brief intro that will eventually list all my skills. As you can see, everything is made with the future in mind. 

// Projects Page
Here I decided to try something interesting. While yes I could do a table containing all the projects, and maybe that is better, I really wanted a carousel that
could be updated and filtered at a later date. I added a search bar (not functioning) at the top and a filter button below (also not functioning) with
this idea in mind. The javascript is still in progress currently for this. 

// Contact Page
Here I created a simple boostrap form to be able to enable people to reach out to me, while also linking it to a free website that can submit these forms
to my e-mail directly. I'd like to figure out how to do this without dependency on the website at a later date but I'm not sure how to do that currently.
The form validates itself but still has a few errors particularly in the e-mail section where e-mails are accepted even without the .com. I'm working on that
as well. 

// Future Goals
I'd like to get all the javascript functioning on the website, and pull away from dependency on the form submission website, as well as migrating this to 
tailwind over boostrap for a more polished feel with more customizability. I've seen what people can do on tailwind and I feel it would provide me more use later
since it seems to be the most popular framework.
